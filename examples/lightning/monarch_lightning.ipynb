    "## Workspace Synchronization with `sync_workspace`\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with distributed training, you often need to modify configuration files, training scripts, or other code locally and sync those changes to remote worker nodes without restarting the entire job. Monarch's `proc_mesh.sync_workspace()` enables this workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Make changes locally** - Edit files in your local workspace (e.g., configuration files, training scripts)\n",
    "2. **Call `sync_workspace()`** - Synchronize changes to all remote worker nodes\n",
    "3. **Continue execution** - The updated files are immediately available on all nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- Tweaking hyperparameters in configuration files\n",
    "- Updating training schedules\n",
    "- Modifying data processing logic\n",
    "- Hot-reloading code changes without job restart\n",
